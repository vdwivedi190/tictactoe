# Reinforcement learning for tic-tac-toe

This is an implementation of reinforcement learning for tic-tac-toe using feedforward neural network. The central idea is to provide the compute with only the rules of the game and win condition, and let it learn by playing against itself. More concretely, the training data for the neural network is generated by playing against itself, with the games generated at each stage of training serving as the training dataset for the next round, thereby improving the performance of the neural network incrementally. 

The motivation for this project was to implement a baby version of [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero) based on [this arXiv article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09259).
